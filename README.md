🧠 Tumor Detection System using MRI Scans<br>
A distributed system for brain tumor detection using MRI scan images, built with PySpark for scalable data processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate tumor classification. The project also includes a user-friendly web frontend to visualize predictions.<br>
<br>
🔍 Project Overview<br>
This project aims to leverage the power of Big Data and Deep Learning to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. It combines:

PySpark for distributed image processing and pipeline orchestration.

CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, custom models) for feature extraction and classification.

Flask frontend for user interaction and tumor prediction visualization.<br>
<br>
🧪 Features<br>
✅ Upload and preprocess large MRI image datasets using PySpark<br>

✅ Train multiple CNN models and compare performance<br>

✅ Predict tumor presence and visualize classification results<br>

✅ Interactive frontend to upload images and get predictions<br>
